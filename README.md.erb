# apl-inputrc

> Easier way to input APL symbols in GNU APL (or other interactive command line

This repository contains an inputrc configuration file meant to be used with
[`rlwrap`][rlwrap] and a command line APL interpreter.

The file contains easy to remember mappings for all symbols used by APL that
are not present on a standard keyboard.

The mappings follow a what-it-looks-like convention. For example, the character
`←` looks like `<-` and so can be typed using a 3 character sequence: `` `<- ``.
Similarly, `∊` is typed as `` `e `` and `⍬` as `` `o~ ``.

If the symbol contains a character that looks similar to a vertically flipped
ASCII character, the mappings use the capitalized version of that character. For
example, `` `t `` is `⊤` and `` `T `` is `⊥`.

## Usage

    $ INPUTRC=/path/to/this/directory/inputrc rlwrap --always-readline apl

where `apl` is the command to start your APL interpreter.

## All Mappings
